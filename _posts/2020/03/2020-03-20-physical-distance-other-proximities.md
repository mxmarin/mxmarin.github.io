Dear Reader, For me, a degree of isolation ameliorates the performance of my auto-immune system. We've been over this: When it detects a danger to my health and well-being in the form of infection, my body attacks me even as it defends me. It perceives my blood-platelets as a threat. The preferred rhetoric for this is that the body is fighting battles in a long war against illness. The assailants are little-known, but some day, if Medicine prevails, none shall be out of grasp and all Humans will be safe. That said, my platelets are not always under attack, only ever at risk. Those particular cells are secondary casualties. A body's functioning may need help, might benefit from treatment. We should all be so lucky. Too few bodies are treated, too few afforded the chance to care for themselves. In the care of medicine, ethics rings hollow. What I am calling medicine is a complex of knowledge and practices – a way of mobilizing this earth's resources. The problem is that the very foundations upon which medicine builds are sick. Medicine cannot heal, when it is so long ill. To make sense of illness, we have brought illness to bear on everyone and everything and created all manner of pathologies. Practices of medicine in 2020 care more about private investment than healing the sick worldwide. Perhaps we are noticing more, that sickness is everywhere, all the time. The 20th century anti-psychiatry movement uncovered that illness is alienation, the prerequisite and result of economic production. They said that illness is the only available way of life under capitalism, because all medicine under capitalism provides 'cure,' it does not heal. As it is, 'curing' can never mean 'abolishing illness,' it means restoring one's ability to work, while we remain ill. There exists a binary cycle between Cured and Healthy. Cured of illness, thus healthy again. Healthy, but eventually in need of cure again. Both are points of illness in time. The practice of curing is focused on economic accumulation. Healthy individuals are the byproduct, capable of working until they need another cure or they retire, at which point they are likely to need cures more often. This much is clear: Every cure costs something in raw material and industrial transformation into commodities, 'goods'. All medicine currently costs money, and its production is for-profit. The purchasing consumer is sometimes an individual, sometimes a public or private institution like a government or an insurance company.  Would that the distribution of healthcare were truly for the good of the people. In Canada, there are many complaints to be made about the function of our public health system, but that's not why I'm writing today. Today I feel lucky to have governance handling most of the finances. Today, many days, I am concerned with philosophy. I am attempting to inhabit realms outside of reality and bring about re-realization. Life follows feeling and thought, and there are always new possibilities beyond the present. My ongoing inquiry into sickness requires traversing away from the consumption of medicine as the only way to do things. I feel many tensions between my body and the care enacted upon it.

Honestly, I am at grips with despair. Part of how I’m coping is escape into a realm of fantasy, where also dwells violence. In reality I practice networked-proximity and maintain physical distance as procedures for harm reduction and self-defense. I have no symptoms, other than being tired. I'm pretty sure most people are tired. I have been reading voraciously in the cozy little apartment where I live. Re-reading LOTR. Last week, Baise-Moi Despentes. Non fiction for myself: _[Turn Illness into a Weapon](http://www.spkpfh.de/index_english.html)_ [by the SPK](http://www.spkpfh.de/index_english.html), _[Gore Capitalism](https://www.akpress.org/gore-capitalism.html)_ [by Sayak Valencia](https://www.akpress.org/gore-capitalism.html), and _[Se défendre](https://www.editionsladecouverte.fr/catalogue/index-Se_d__fendre-9782355221101.html)_ [par Elsa Dorlin](https://www.editionsladecouverte.fr/catalogue/index-Se_d__fendre-9782355221101.html) (English tr. 2021). Right before the university closed down, I attended [a talk by Sayak Valencia](http://www.optica.ca/programmation/index.php#982), and learned a lot. In these [troubling times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZHurGcoRmQ), I'm inclined to believe that _auto-immunity_ is a form of _self-defense_, and that sickness is a form of resistance.  Otherwise, I have been
