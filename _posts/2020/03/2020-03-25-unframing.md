###### **IMG: Drawing is a [Self-Portrait by Ernst Mach (1886)](https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/self-portrait-by-ernst-mach-1886). Photograph by M-X Marin (2017). The drawing by Mach is also known as** _**View from the left eye**_**. Mach illustrates what his left eye perceives of his body and a room when he closes his right eye, as an exercise in self-knowing and inspection of the ego. MX's photograph is formally inspired from the drawing, but takes a wintry day for its subject. Photographed through the left lens of their glasses, MX's** _**View**_ **disembodies vision and apprehends a wider environment.**

Dear Reader, I am troubled by our senses, and sight's legacy within feeling. We tend to impose _perception_ rather than feel with honesty. "Framing" so much as the birds we may hear or the earth we lay on. Verily, enframing is sight's doing, vision's call to arms. Consider blind gain as an _unframing._ Framing restricts fields of experience, like we have long penned animals: to keep them in sight, under relative control. Frames are borders: geometric and geographic, imposed by the Eye's vision. Framing establishes a relationship of domination between parties meeting upon the field. Given that sight is essentially limited, it seeks unseen territories to reveal in order to deepen, widen, and stratify its expanse. Sight is a tool, wielded by Power, so that previously-unseen others may be ensnared and dispossessed by its frames. Sight is a barometer of what is allowed within or without, as human or other, white or other, man or other, straight or other, living or dead. Sight lacks nuance, even in its waning imperial rule. Sight is the trouble we stay with even while learning about alternatives. We're stuck with it, as seers or seen and often as both. [Predator and prey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=assDsc-TRY4), we use perception in the hunt. Apprehensions of the world get weaponized and turned against others who aren't in the right pack. We might call this pack the sovereign, he (rarely, she) who has command of the situation and seeks to control events. This dominant pack is in flux, its actual membership counting more or fewer depending on moods picked or rules followed. To the ruler, all others are prey to be hunted or harnessed for the good of the pack. The prey are lives for the taking, and our membership changes also. Prey may prey on others, in time. Some are tracked ruthlessly by physical act of violence. Others are allowed out to pasture, so long as the fences, our frames, are not widely transgressed. Transgressive is any act which would break down the frames and create unseen realms of possibility for the lives of prey. Blind gain is an unframing, an unseeing, a re-realizing without borders, where we may share with each other what we know and what we might use. In a time when so many of us are to remain in our homes, under control, for _safety_, our knowledge-sharing practices must reflect a desire to break down dominant repressive forms of thought. All of us in our homes are prey, upon whom the predators may be called. As the pandemic unfolds, we are daily shaping the future realities we will inhabit once the crisis ends. Will we emerge into a State of ever-increasing repression, where the powers-that-be have increased in this interim of healthcare crisis, or will we find new freedoms have been created through collective action?

It is Spring in the city. Can you smell it? Not only does the sun shine and the air breathe, but my heart’s grief is lightened. I am laid bare to myself in isolation, and can only feel deeply. I would not hide from this, the truth of my body: Pain is a guide. My chest is racked with sorrow appearing as a vice grip within its right-side chamber. I bring my attention to the pain, bear it while I have will to do so, and so it hurts me a little less. It is fear and the unknown which causes me such distress. Acknowledging them is the way I choose. A _gom jabbar_ of sorts: Feel pain in order to learn. An important difference between the literary device and reality: the handing-down of death is not immediate, and there are many opportunities for trial. We endeavour to find and foster hope. No one knows. There are no experts, so there is room for all knowings. Behold, change. How apt that its herald be viral, sprung from animalistic bodies of the earth.
