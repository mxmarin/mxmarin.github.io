The love of the Hobbits for each other and nature is the strongest aspect of the storytelling. The writing is in those instances deeply compassionate and moving. However, Tolkien's treatment of Eowyn of Rohan's character is disappointing.

Inspired by her, I wrote this poem:  
_Thought escapes, sight ends, thus death becomes_  
Happy sunrise, Though we mourn.  
Abandon normalcy, all ye living beings  
Join the dead and dying  
Who have long learned other ways  
We do not desire the speech of living men  
Would that we might bear our sorrows  
as man thinks only he may.  
But we too contend with  
Depths of Despair  
and verily do we feel them  
and no words of men shall cure us  
and no tales of glory regale us  
For it is not understanding we lack  
As if a transplantation of mind may help.  
We know the tides of Time  
in our hearts we keep them  
and on our words they fly  
Without ownership nor debt  
For it is Power that is wrong  
He has no will to die.

She is the most sorrowful character in the story, and deserves her full complexity, rather then the write-off change-of-heart moment she suffers at the hands of Faramir, who is himself acting as Tolkien's mouthpiece. Glad to have now read the story in its original language. Eventually I'll scour the rest of this world. 8/10.
