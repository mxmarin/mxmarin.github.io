A novel by Virginie Despentes filled with hate-love, envy, greed, and fantasy. Twin sisters share a life, manipulate each other and everyone else, and constantly dream of escape. I've previously read Apocalypse Bébé, King Kong Théorie, and Baise Moi by V.D. Reading her work is always a visceral experience. This novel dives into Looking, and reveals the shame and sadness that may be brought on by a gaze. Characters bond over shares stares at bodies and at screens. The content is a pop-stardom rise-to-fame story filled with scandal and clever schemes to make it in 1990s Paris.
