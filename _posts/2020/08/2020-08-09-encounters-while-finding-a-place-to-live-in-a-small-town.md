-- Sexism.

-- So many half-basements.

-- Very helpful individuals.

-- Folks are more likely to say hello when I cross them on the street, or maybe I am more likely to do so, and people just respond.

-- Very unhelpful individuals.

-- Everyone has a mask handy.

-- To locals, it's obvious I'm new. To tourists, I might be from around here.

-- People asking who my family is. (we've been here as settlers since the 17th century)

-- The sound of the beach is never far away.

-- Water tastes like a little bit like dirt. (this is good)

-- Some chairs in my grandmother's home creak.

-- Everyone I've seen passes for white, including me.

-- My french is up to par, but obviously not from around here.

-- The grocery store is almost overpriced.

-- Rich people with summer homes.

-- Pickup trucks.

-- Trailer homes.

-- Bookstore and library with limited philosophy selections, extensive pop-fiction sections.

-- Many cyclists, few pedestrians.

-- Sleep schedule immediately reset to 9pm-6am upon arrival.

-- One of the bakeries is only open on Saturdays.

-- Stones melded with other stones by the sheer force of time.

-- A shrine to a deceased crab.

-- Many crab shells washed ashore.

-- A failed attempt to leap across a stream.

-- Heavy rain.

-- Lone grasshopper quietly sharing my blanket for a while.

-- August sunshine that does not strike like a hammer.

-- Not many sidewalks, fewer curb-cuts.

-- Low population density. (perhaps that much is obvious)

-- A sculpture of a 250lbs trout, commemorating its capture by amateur fishermen.

-- More tourists than pandemic should have allowed.

-- Enough tourists for local business not to go bankrupt.

-- Maybe (maybe) 1 other queer person, who doesn't even live here.

-- Sand made of a billion small stones.
