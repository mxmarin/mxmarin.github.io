How Many Servers Get Activated now when I boot up this domain? How much electricity does that use? What generates that? I just learned that websites can be powered with wind, if you don't worry too much about uptime. So share the latest packets sporadically. And that trees can be used to make wind energy. Trees grow quicker than rocks. Salvage, and reshape. Humus is plenty if continually replenished, nourished, if we give to trees, they will return the favour. With love, we give to trees.

If my personal sometimes-powered-access-point has the opportunity to fetch from more reliable servers, and other folks are also reaching for those given servers, then somehow the global connectivity may be kept. Is it because of the wires? The cables? Oh, I get it. Wireless is a myth. Right. Of course. Except electricity has been channeled into air before. How did that happen? Did it require fewer rare rocks? More glass? How long has glass been around? Sand seems more abundant than lithium. Perhaps it has not always been so? I've heard that civilizations leave deserts in their wake. Hmm.

Trees don't lead to deserts though. From what I gather so far, trees are cornocopic. How do you run email from a cyclically-powered server? It's just about how far down the circuitry you can get the power to flood, right?
