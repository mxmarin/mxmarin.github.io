title: Goodbye?
date: 2020-09-01

Do we hug? Look? Say? Scream? Dance? Mirror? Wave? Lock-step? Shrug? Refuse? Acknowledge? Turn away? Run? Shout? Weep? Why? What's so sad about a departure? Is it the place or the people? I'm not sure the trees will even notice, but I hope some of them might. Perhaps that's my ego going on in futility. I've made friend with the people here, made friend with some streets, made friends with one or two wasps and one or two birds, long gone. I was acquainted with the ghost that lived in my studio apartment, and ghost stories from a few other buildings. I've come to know the way the asphalt vibrates on Sherbrooke when a dump-truck drives by, or how the dirt path along the train tracks carries my bike's gatorskins. How do I say goodbye to the art, to the music? How do I depart from a place? How do I leave right as autumn begins? Why do I go when I've only begun to explore the markets, the people? I certainly won't miss the cars, the noise. I'll long for my loves and wish them all farewell, but I don't expect I'll envy them as winter rolls around and I stare out the window at the sea freezing over and know that out the window of my friend's home back in the city, all that's freezing is the battered asphalt.
