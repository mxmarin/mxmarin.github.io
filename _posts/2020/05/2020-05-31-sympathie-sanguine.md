There's no doubt in my mind that inside the body is blood's rightful place.

Bloodiness is a magnetism, an earthiness. Observing my own arms the veins are hills and tunnels. They bulge and recess in turn. It's commonplace for a nurse in a talkative mood to comment on their quality. Expert appraisal has it: my veins are ripe for harvest. Not that any of us are too eager. Nurses are labouring, sticking needles into veins for days on end. Most nurses are highly skilled at this task. It barely hurts. Commendable.

I'm trying to imagine my own blood. Create chances to hear it. Lorsque je m'assois bien calmement sur mon petit coussin bleu, je perçois cette pulsion intérieure. Me voici, mécanicien de mon propre corp, ayant à jauger son fonctionnement et effectuer les changements d'huile. Remembering follows loss, memory is split fragments reassembled in a whole different reality than was happening in the spacetimes collated. Blood is a form of gravity.

I'll go back to the beginning. It was a red day. We weren't used to those. So red as to stain my vision. Red with confusion and physical pain. Red with weep, sorrow. Red like the couches and the carpets of the first clinic we rushed to. Red, the blood that had starting seeping into my right eye after impact from a toy in the school yard, the serrated plastic edge of a joycopter.

The first blood test I remember came soon after. I was 5 years old at British Columbia Children's hospital. The blood draw clinic was a couple floors up from the hospital lobby which had this massive plastic tree in it. We took the elevator up and upon exit there were a series of signs to follow. All the walls on this level were painted sky blue and decorated with flying creatures, bears in aeroplanes, clouds rainbows sunshine you know, the usual hospital festivity.

So we follow the party to the clinic. Waiting room was pretty small, maybe 40 chairs. Blue walls. A TV somewhere in the corner. Pulp magazines for parents to pretend-read. Toys laid out on a table. Arrival and check-in, a little window in the wall next to a door through which we'd soon pass. We, being myself Maman the other kids and parents waiting. The first time, I just sat there not wholly cognizant of what was about to happen.

My feet didn't reach the floor maybe my legs were too short or the chair's too long. Swung back-forth in ignorant anticipation or maybe simple boredom. Waiting rooms used to elicit boredom for me. I probably stared at the television, the best way to forget a body until smartphones. I've noticed that most hospital waiting rooms don't have shows on anymore nor do they call people out by name. Maybe in the children's hospitals they still do. At the CHUM the teevees just have numbers on them and every time the numbers change there's a Ding so as to make everyone look up only to dash the patient hopes of all but one bored soul whose turn it finally is to get evaluated. Anyway at BC children's in 2001 they called me by name and we passed into the back room, through a doorway, and then another, each room lined with stations having all the fixings needed for sanitary blood sample harvest. I'm led to the deepest section of blue-walled-room and sat in a too-big chair designed for maximum clinical comfort. It dawns on me why we're here as the nurse explains the procedure.

I scream.

Before blood was medicine it was earth borne of generations sowing their seeds. For all the talk of purity commingling is the way of the world. Assume that blood itself exists in superposition and that blood is the locus of spirit. A mode of transition, transportation, transmission, diffraction. In the dirt, blood learns what comes of experimentation. According to hebrew scripture, the very life of the creature is in the blood. Un flot vivant cette boueuse rivière rouge pleine d'esprit. Cela serait une grave erreur de penser que les histoires que chuchote le sang sont sans conflits. Le sang de la mère française-anglaise, du Québec, porte des siècles de vie coloniale, cette violence. Par le sang du père Israélien juif d'ascendence roumaine la souffrance du peuple découle. Et pourtant par hasard me voici.

Some things should be red. Blood, for instance. Crimson Red, hemochrome. So red you can not look away. Blood is variously red based on its level of oxygenation. Too concerned with the red of blood. What of its blues? Result of how light traverses skin on a pale body, crimson arteries appear blue-green on the surface.

If blood yields knowledge then it also lies. Barren, the land presided upon by supposed victors for whom spilt crimson is better than drunk. Would that the ground forget what flows unto the roots, yet the fruit remembers torn flesh. I am no apple picker, but a worm feeding on the spoils of war. Bone begets bone and we twirl ever onward, quick to forget and slow to unlearn. Fragmentary days whisper: the night is not for you to explore. What is hidden in the blood? Why must the corpse be boxed or burned, its water wrought, never free to return? Upon death, leave me in the earth or the sea with nothing but a silver ring. Pine coffins suffocate where decay may pine for roots. Barriers sunk needlessly, why individualize even decomposition? If the law should get in the way, or the forest be too sparse, burn the body and scatter ashes amongst the lichen.

This is how I worship  
In breath and blood  
Living until death.

In dreams I don't see the blood draw happen only empty blue hallways and the echos of my wailing. Now it seems that was the moment my own mortality first mattered. What do you think children in cities feel right now? I don't know, probably they are afraid, they may be afraid of death, I don't know. I loved being a child, call it whatever you want. People don't get that freedom long at all.
