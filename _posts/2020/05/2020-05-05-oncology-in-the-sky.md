title: "The Oncology Ward In The Sky"

I recently decided not to get a blood test following an anxious voicemail left and phone conversation had with ext.-Nurse (bless them) at the CHUM. They reassured me that the oncology floors are maintained as safe havens and access is limited. Good, thank you, that is reassuring to hear, I am still not going until further notice. Right now I do not want to inhale hospital air. I'm more concerned about my asymptomatic self bringing a respiratory disease into a cancer ward than worried of catching it on my way there and or back. I don't want more people to suffer or to burden care workers. So I stick to home, parks, supply runs, and avoid the onco-haemato-logy ward in the sky. The _centre de prélèvements_ take blood from 7am-3pm M-F. It is a resolutely functional and hygienic place. For patients who get blood taken here up high, wait times are in my experience usually under 30 minutes. Very short hospital wait time. On the north east-and-west of the building there are stickers affixed to the panes forming a large pattern visible from the streets. Out the waiting room windows on set up along a hallway on the 14th floor - 150 chairs max - I see so many individual blue hues: near to eye are those stickers, each one containing a seemingly random word _en français_ and the sky, the city, beyond. Here's a photo for the sighted among us:

Un matin j'arrive à l'hôpital à 6:55am. Il pleut une bruine d'automne, le soleil est couché. La construction du nouveau pavillon est encore aussi bruyante. Je passe par l'entrée principale, je me désinfecte les mains, puis je me dirige vers les ascenseurs. Un jour peut-être que je comprendrai pourquoi l'hémato et l'onco se partage un département. Je fais toujours mes prises de sang au bras gauche. J'arrive au centre de prélèvements et c'est la manche gauche que je soulève. Signal à l'infirmière de se déplacer du côté choisi, qui n'est pas la norme. En 2019 j'y vais environ aux 2 semaines, ça laisse assez de temps que même quand l'aiguille laisse un bleu dans le creux du bras on puisse repiquer la veine. Elle a eu le temps de se guérir. Je choisie la gauche afin de pouvoir mieux observer la chose. Je n'ai pas à tourner la tête de manière incommode. La gauche me permet un coup d'oeil facile. Je doit regarder. C'est un besoin depuis bien longtemps. Réflexe qui s'oppose à l'inconfort de regarder les aiguilles. Jeune, je détournais la vue. Je leurs dits: Faites, et décompter que j'entende venir l'aiguille. 3...2...1... Sharp insertion somewhere along the arm. Middling. En 2017 j'ai été hospitalisée à notre-dame en plein milieu d'une période ardemment photographique de ma vie. Allongée au lit, j'ai photographiée l'acte, la prise. Depuis, je regarde. Mon oeil utile me transmet les infos sur le progrès des tubes. For years they've been working on adding a third even taller wing to the CHUM first completed in 2017. Before then, I got my blood tests at _l'hôpital notre-dame_,__ an old old building. The CHUM built now has another high capacity blood-draw clinic on the main floor of D-wing but I've never sat there in that glass box within the heart of the skyscraper complex with no view outside for patients. No, for some reason I take the elevator. I've once stayed overnight at the Nouveau-CHUM in an ER hallway on a cot under fluorescents. It was mid-march of 2019 so really that month is fucked every year. In the morning Dr. O is on duty and comes to see me at bedside. I say I'm fine. He says you're not fine listen to these numbers we'll up your dose of Revolade and deliver intravenous iron also request an appointment with the gastroenterologist who once before examined your sedated flesh because surely if you're this anaemic your stomach must be bleeding. Alright then, we say. As he discharges me, the doctor jokes about how nice the rooms are up on the 15th floor as if hospitalization is the right thing to chuckle warmly about. I think he's well-intentioned and has a good grasp of haematological medicine. He's managed my file since March the year I turned 19. He's nice, too. Anyway I was glad to leave, go home and spend a month in bed resting feeling like death is the only imperative as the weather turned warm outside. When I go interact with a business I wear a mask but have given up on masking myself for a stroll to the park. Those me not-me barriers are worn as self-defense. My body is trying its best with what it knows of the long-winded lie that is that there is self and there is other. I trust the precautions I am taking are enough for me whose overall risk is low. I trust the air with my immune system. But I do not trust my body to visit a hospital right now. I am angry that it has to be this way, and I am scared. I do not know what happens to my body when the numbers stop determining how it exists, but I do not want to measure the passing of time with numbers and test results. My partner brings their world to me and we share stories whispering back and forth of then there here now conspiring liquidity atmospheric coalitions brewing. Limbo feels longer and shorter every single day. Is today the last day of the week or the fifth what's the date? We weep in turns _Come on friend what's anything worth right this second institutions are closing their doors. People are going back to work? Money still has value and I am sad for fucks sake yeah me too wanna talk about it? nah yeah me neither K sweet_ Breathing is a reminder of life as well as a way of giving thanks. Over facebook messenger I ask my estranged father what worries him right now. How many people will die, are dying, he says. Mae and I have gone on some walks, sat in some municipal parks. Other people breathe nearby. I wonder where they've been recently. How many of them bring a hospital's airspace with them to the park? Just out of the allotted physical range, but I'm aware that they are also breathing as they talk and laugh and drink and smoke sometimes making the wind visible for an moment. Breathing's taught me that my own egotistic duality may cease to exist as I inhale and exhale with the world atmosphere. Wind catches my pores and carries my body dust along with each of yours so we conspire regardless of distance bridging vast expanses across nothingness in order to be together. I live very far from the front lines. I don't know what it's like to live with combat nearby. All I know of such places has come to me through images videos words, most of my senses spared the ample truth smells, the shock. I know only a fantasy, fictitious war. Yet war and I share an atmosphere. We breathe within one another, please welcome the medics wherever there is fighting. What is there to gain from the veritable assault on human sensory capacity, from mass death? I desire counter-offensive measures but who doesn't? Anyone whose ever been hurt has tried retaliation, tried hurting back. Lately my reading has taken me into potential histories where men still wreak havoc but others resist and defend themselves in so many ways. The air we share is risky, so we determine how much risk we're willing to handle at a given moment. I conspire to emit air which filters out suffering and positively impact any brief encounter. I share the results with the inevitable passersby no matter which precautions we take. I choose to continue sharing air. Circumstances may make that difficult or impossible. I choose this consciously, so I do not bow before inevitability. The inevitable does not rule me. Why should it? I treat those inevitabilities I have learned as parts of the air and blood streams. Death, disease, love, hope are known to me. Stating the obvious helps me stay grounded I guess, I think it's because I'm used to my life-force being a numbers game. You know like stats in an RPG trying to min-max numbers to attain optimal efficiency. We're basically machines anyway right like so many dudes have said that, seems ridiculous though idk. I think we're more like mycelia or maybe trees.
