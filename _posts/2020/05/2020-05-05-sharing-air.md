In the midst of pandemic I have gone on some walks, sat in some municipal parks. Other people breathe nearby. I wonder where they've been recently. How many of them bring a hospital's airspace with them to the park? Just out of the allotted physical range, but I'm aware that they are also breathing as they talk and laugh and drink and smoke sometimes making the wind visible for an moment, inhale and exhale with the world atmosphere. Wind catches my pores and carries my body dust along with each of yours so we conspire regardless of distance, bridging vast expanses across nothingness in order to be together. I live very far from the front lines. I don't know what it's like to live with combat nearby. All I know of such places has come to me through images videos words, most of my senses spared the ample truth smells, the shock. I know only a fantasy, fictitious war. Yet war and I share an atmosphere. We breathe within one another, please welcome the medics wherever there is fighting. What is there to gain from the veritable assault on human sensory capacity, from mass death? I desire counter-offensive measures but who doesn't? Anyone whose ever been hurt has tried retaliation, tried hurting back. Lately my reading has taken me into potential histories where men still wreak havoc but others resist and defend themselves in so many ways. The air we share is risky, so we determine how much risk we're willing to handle at a given moment. I conspire to emit air which filters out suffering and positively impact any brief encounter. I share the results with the inevitable passersby no matter which precautions we take.

I wear a mask indoors and in close quarters but have given up on masking myself for a stroll to the park. My body is trying its best with what it knows of the long-winded lie that is that there is self and there is other. I trust the precautions I am taking are enough for me and those I interact with. I trust the air with my immune system. But I do not trust my body to visit a hospital right now. I am angry that it has to be this way, and I am scared. I do not know what happens to my body when the numbers stop determining how it exists, but I do not want to measure the passing of time with numbers and test results.

My partner brings their world to me and we share stories whispering back and forth of then there here now conspiring liquidity atmospheric coalitions brewing. Limbo feels longer and shorter every single day.

Breathing is a reminder of life as well as a way of giving thanks. Over facebook messenger I ask my estranged father what worries him right now. How many people will die, are dying, he says.


I choose to continue sharing air. Circumstances may make that difficult or impossible. I choose this consciously, so I do not bow before inevitability. The inevitable does not rule me. Why should it? I treat those inevitabilities I have learned as parts of the air and blood streams. Death, disease, love, hope are known to me. Stating the obvious helps me stay grounded I guess, I think it's because I'm used to my life-force being a numbers game. You know like stats in an RPG trying to min-max numbers to attain optimal efficiency. We're basically machines anyway right like so many dudes have said that, seems ridiculous though idk. I think we're more like mycelia or maybe trees.


Atunement to lived bodies has shifted. Touch screams, loud, when the body feels unknown skin. Brushed up against a cashier's hand as they hand me a receipt, their mouth beyond the counter's plastic shielding. Our breaths shouldn't mingle, I'm wearing a mask and hopefully they are too. Surface boundaries are tricky. Skin keeps the blood in, but it doesn't keep the world out.
