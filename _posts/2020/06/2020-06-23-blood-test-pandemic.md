 Who cares, doc? My dear Dr., do you partake in the blood of christ? What do you make of that? What about blood magick, doc? How do you like you steaks? Do you ever go trapping, look a wild animal in the eye as you slaughter them with a knife? No, of course not, seeing as you won't bleed me yourself. Division of wage labour says that you tick boxes on a sheet, stamp a signature, and look at numbers on a screen after the nurse has relieved me of blood and the lab tech has scanned it. How come you didn't decide to be an accountant instead, doc? Must be because an accountant doesn't get to chemically re-balance human bodies and see how that turns out. Must be because an accountant's numbers are fictional abstractions while your numbers are anchored in blood. Blood money's real too, doc. Some accountants get to count up the numbers for their boss whose business it is to bleed people day in day out. Violence specialists. Stroke of a pen on a ledger, offshore, how's that different from a gunshot, doc? What if my blood were inside black skin instead, doc? Would the government still pay my bills? Maybe they would, just to see that sixty thousand dollars a year go to a multinational pharmaceutical company instead of social welfare. Attunement to lived bodies has shifted. Touch screams, loud, when the body feels unknown skin. Brushed up against a cashier's hand as they hand me a receipt, their mouth beyond the counter's plastic shielding. Our breaths shouldn't mingle, I'm wearing a mask and hopefully they are too. Surface boundaries are tricky. Skin keeps the blood in, but it doesn't keep the world out.
