Back in march, apocalypse rose up to meet me. I became aware of its absolute magnitude. It even smells undeniably real, now. I am late to the game.

I am none too fond of so-called expert authority. The institutions that legitimate claims to expertise (academia, archives, science, politics, media) are part and parcel of racist imperial systems (prisons, nations, banks) that have unevenly distributed risk and vulnerability to loss across space and time. Some people are being murdered in the streets while others hoard wealth and hire enforcers. Some people are fleeing climate devastation while others privatize the world's water. Some people are laying deathly ill while others enjoy leisure. Where is justice? The world is aflame. A sick civilization flares righteous anger in the face of aspiring and established despots. People bleed in long fights for change, and who's to say what's possible?

It is my belief that anyone who tells another person what to think, rather than sharing how they think, is suspicious and ought to be questioned. I will not write about others' suffering when I do not personally know and have not experienced it. Welcome to The Transfusion.

A deepened sense of presence on earth inhabits me. Water, dirt. I am slowing down. Trying to connect each morning with hunger rather than immediately eating. Each day is one of heartbreak, healing, and love. My longing is to know my body, keep it for a while, and know the place I am going to decompose before decomposing. Get to befriending the trees there, help the forest heal too.

Years ago, my connection to the earth was ripped away by hospitalization. Hospitals reared me as a pathological child, chronically ill. Now my doctor wants to see my blood within a month. Poison and cure, the body's water is pharma's locus, the bloodstream is why and how we get off. Living blind within sickness, I used to trust wholly in medicine's optics and chemistry. I was afraid of different things before. Knew less, and slowly awakened to death. I can't imagine how the nurse's hands are going to feel, being the second human's touch since march.

What's happened? Nothing, I'm fine. Slavery Shoah Monotheism Europe Colonies Ecocide, to name a few. People say climate change, like change is so bad. The whole cycle of infinitesimal parts together making matter and ether. God is change, as inevitable as love, life, itself. Why make a bloodbath of living? Is it out of fear that after-life is being withheld? Yet change is very much alive, in all its bloodiness and its disease. Here's how I feel lately: Civilization is not an inevitability. It is an idea, humanity's attempt at self-definition by fragmentation. Humanity's prayer to death.

No one has ever told me I am going to die of an illness. Not before, not now. My doctor said: "The odds of you dying to covid are near zero. I know you won't do anything reckless." He told me so over the phone. Fair enough, haematology has kept me alive thus far. Physical injury is perhaps what I have most actively avoided in my life, but I'm ripe for a bleeding.
