Lately I've been:
- Reading. (To-do: publish my 2020 booklist).
- Praying. This is not an activity I've ever undertaken with any regularity in the past. My meditation practice became daily this year, and in my study I found that prayer is a mantric form of meditation that has benefits for the one who prays. So I figured I'd give it a shot. A question that prompted this as well: Do you know what Holy feels like to you? 
- Listening to podcasts: Rune Soup, Against Everyone With Conner Habib.
- Practicing Tai-chi.
- Going on walks (not today though, I'm tired).
- Cutting processed foods out of my diet bit by bit.
- Breathing, conspiring.
- Learning about astrology.
- Learning about economics.
- Learning about quantum physics.
- Discussing anarchy.
- Coming to sensory experience of communion with my ancestors.
- Contemplating what to do with my life.
- Feeling lonely.
- Watching: Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Avatar: The Last Airbender.
- Writing longhand on paper. Switched to pencil, from pen, because my cartridges ran out and I have so many pencils handy.
- Dream journaling. The more this is done, the more detailed and vivid the recall and experience of dream.
- Visiting my grandmother.

This blog has weighed heavy on my mind some days. I don't want to write it as a means to share purely about illness. Not that I've exhausted that topic, but the ideas need to foment privately for a while. I do want to update it regularly, and I am interested in building this website to have more functionality. I'll get one post up per week, even if it's just a bullet-pointed list. Probably, many more book reviews to come.
