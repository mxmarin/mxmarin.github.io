title: Transcribing Old Journals
---
I've been transcribing my old handwritten journals into the computer. I started keeping handwritten logs in 2016, once I learnt that I wouldn't be allowed a laptop in certain university classrooms. A challenge turned into a blessing as I rapidly grew to love the process of scrawling. 

Reading back, it's fascinating how quickly my relationship to the act shifted. In May 2016, my handwriting was near illegible, the notes pointform, the questions vapid. It's like I didn't know what to do with a blank page. This much is obvious: practice breeds practice; writing is a habit and a muscle that builds with use. 

Early on, the spontaneity of handwritten journaling won me over. I lived a routine of constantly running from home to class to work to various social engagements; the journal always lived in my bag. I got into using the same format over and over: an 8.5x11 flip-over with tear-out 3-hole lined paper, and a hard back. Excellent for scrawling out manic reflections on my day as I sat in the metro on the 45 minute commute to campus. The evolution of the journal's content over just that first year reflects the beginning of my introspective journey. 

Many beginnings coalesce: Keeping a journal, meditation, reflection on a life of illness. In these early attempts to verbalize my experiences, I read frustration, and occasionally explicit fear and rage. 4 years is a short blip on long time-scales but in my early 20s it seems safe to say my consciousness evolved precipitously. 

It's painful to read some of the things I put down on the pages. I'm only glad most of those thoughts stayed private. My relationship to myself and the world around me was spiteful, loathsome. I recognize many of my worst impulses taking center stage in those notes. At the same time, certain seeds of the direction I've taken in life are apparent even then; I'm not a fundamentally different person, just more aligned with love. 

In 2016 I lived anxiously, day in day out. Many an entry treats the discomfort of embodiment, the fear. I was living fuelled by caffeine and alcohol, still, and wondered why my body screamed warnings. I wasn't yet ready to relax into the memories that arose when I let myself come to a position of rest. The memories of trauma are deep-seated and painful, breed terror and halt breath, but the process at least is one of healing. Reading back, I see a scared youth unwilling to stop and listen to their own heart.
