title: Bacigalupi's Symphony of Violence
---
If you're looking for dystopia asking relevant questions, here it is. I read Paolo Bacigalupi's fiction as basically continuous with the current realities of earth. I've read his YA undertakings: _Ship Breaker, Drowned Cities_, and _Tool of War_. This trilogy transposes conditions of ecological devastation reminiscent of the ship breaking yards of Bangladesh. Page after page I was tossed into reams of hyperviolence on the front lines of climate havoc into a version of turtle island made unfamiliar by the passage of ambiguous time. All three books resonate with P.B's earlier _The Windup Girl_, wherein a future fictional Thailand contends with the biopiracy of Monsanto-esque agricultural pirates on the other side of Globalization's collapse to disease and food scarcity, depicting bioengineering as a tool of greed amongst gamblers on the scale of populations.

_The Water Knife_ chronicles water wars along the Colorado River in a perhaps nearer future. Cautionary Climate fiction mixed with crime thriller in the arizona desert as cops journalists and gangsters tango to find out who has water exploitation Rights, a bill of property touted as "older than god", for the sake of legal permission to run the depleting aquifers dryer and dryer. 

Reading Bacigalupi is fun. It's thrilling. His stories advance at a breakneck pace, and span the globe over the oeuvre. Through the entertainment that are pop novels, he does not hesitate to depict child soldiers, starvation, racist assault, sexual exploitation. His protagonists are manifold and engaging, their ethical questioning is sustained as they are strung along the pages. Recommended.
