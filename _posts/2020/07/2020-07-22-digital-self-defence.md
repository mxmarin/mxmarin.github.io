Sucked whirling into the wrong abyss, and I hardly know what it _is._ We finger screens and website trackers lift a fingerprint. Information aquifers are forming to replace the lost water. The network’s obscene metal wires carry user profiles across ocean floors while the spectacle flashes onscreen. We all leave traces in the cloud, on the ground.

Is data an extension of ourselves and our private lives, or is it a commodity to be exchanged in a contract? Extralegal contract-bundles millions of words long provide “notice” and demand wholly uninformed consent to policies users are not meant to read, circumventing laws to create always-on global surveillance for the profit of corporate players. Each keystroke hides so much metadata production, surreptitiously lifted by the scripts encoded to the network we ping with our metal boxes, dripping into vast and unknown repositories held by data controllers.

Data, mined from bodies as surely as gold from the earth. As we sleep, bodies of data are scoured for useful information to exploit, to create an ever-more-precise graph of reality. It’s just words, numbers, symbols to represent the capacity for storing knowledge, machined to perform on command. Analysis of the stockpile goes on, ever accelerating, the bits of binary adding up to fine-grained categorizations of how populations think and consume, figuring out what me and my friends will want in the future.

Behavioural data is computed to sell predictions, and digital oracles are increasingly accurate. Targeted ads are bought and sold based on nebulous speculation. Corporate internet giants utilize people to breed information, use it to reinforce the ideological norms of developers and shareholders collecting and disseminating data for economic profit and political power. It seems personal data is still treated with undue flippancy. I wonder how often something checks whether or not I am online.

When did anyone consent to the digital dragnet? Just when the ocean consented to industrial fisheries. Suppose we treated our data as offspring. What if we cared for our data as for families, for lovers? Protected them, and kept them safe. Imagine personal data isn’t digital ether but flesh prone to tearing. Surely we must staunch the blood.

The _p__rivacy paradox_ is the name given to discrepancies between expressed privacy concerns and actual online behaviour. Social scientific research finds that individuals follow their instincts when considering whether or not to share information, and do not necessarily assess potential security risks. Alternatively, someone may have considered the risks, but is unable to act in their best self-interest due to external factors, such as: low transparency, user unfriendly design, or consumer hostile privacy policies with all-or-nothing usage. Online companies mostly operate on a Notice-and-Choice legal doctrine. That is: because they provide us with a URL to their ‘privacy policy’ which discloses the specific ways in which our data will be used, users are considered to have been informed of the contract to which we are agreeing when we use a given service.

Put simply: A person looking for involvement in life online is misled to discount potential worries about privacy. Individuals do what needs to be done in order to engage with our peers. I think the privacy paradox results in part from a sense of emotional detachment from our information. Is data too far out of the reach of our bodies for us to have any stake in its protection? What if we grew more attached to data, felt a connection akin to empathy? Would we be less reluctant to carry out the necessary actions of digital self-defence?

I am trying to make sense of just how my body extends into the digital, just how it is usurped. Australian academic Gavin JD Smith named _disembodied exhaust_ the “data trails that are either voluntarily or involuntarily emitted from the body as it interfaces with networked sensor technologies. Disembodied exhaust gives rise to a data-proxy, an abstracted figure created from the amalgamation of data traces.” Smith’s data-proxy expands the body’s boundaries to remake humanity in the shape of data. Metadata speaks louder than content in the digital realm, a clarion call for corporate attention.

Flesh bodies tapped into the internet emit flows of information to an infrastructure of software and hardware. We hold no power over whether or not data is created about us, and can only choose how to respond, how to shape our relationships with data. A social networking algorithm’s task is to keep a user engaged, keep us clicking. It does not matter _what_ I click, but _that_ I click, or buy, or ask alexa a question, or drive a networked car. Whenever we interact with information technologies we enact a carefully engineered dissociation from our own data, accounting to the algorithms and analysts of the proverbial big-data playground. Behaviour is monitored, predicted, and influenced using data, and thus habits are reinforced in perpetual feedback loops.

There is no separating disembodied exhaust from our thoroughly enfleshed lives. I resign myself to accept a data-proxy as a part of my body today, but I refuse to consider my data lost in advance, to think myself wholly alienated from it. We must not consider data as a static object we discard, but always remember that it is iterative, flowing out in waves, existing in many places. Digital natives are not just the youth who’ve grown up browsing social networks, they are the populations of scavengers breaking down e-waste for scraps to eke out a living in the landfills of digital industry, while the consuming populace scrolls in outrage, shares a link, moves on.

All relationships are invaded by data, progressively reducing life on earth to forms of existence that can be shipped in packets and held in servers. The algorithm is in tune with a global pulse. Our own acts of knowledge making are consumed by networked scripts in a continuous accumulation. If data, created from all the actions we take online and many we take offline, is used to create a proxied version of ourselves, then data is not excess, it is the digital lifeblood of humanity.

I am not after total invisibility or anonymity from the global surveillance state. That doesn’t seem like a viable option, nor is it necessary. What I am after is tracking evasion. It is enough for me that corporate advertisers do not have a line-perfect profile of my daily life anymore. It is enough that my digital fingerprint is somewhat blurred. The most effective form of digital resistance is disengagement from the dragnets of hegemonic social networks. Data proxies are artifacts, separated from factual life. Stop feeding them, and they slowly decay.

Cooperation is required to know what anyone is thinking, feeling. The mad and the sick learned long ago that subjective experience is the only realm impervious to the scientific gaze. Computers can tally up medical data and save lives without ever valuing the love and rage of sick people. Contact tracing is nothing new—it’s only recently deployed at scale. A smartphone makes patients of us all, turns the city into a hospital ward. What if individuals chose, actively, on an ongoing basis, when and where to disclose information? Identity, name, and body, legal and fixed, yet in flux. The recognizable markers of a citizen, archived privately by public institutions, access restricted to a select few concerned parties. I imagine a doctor’s consultation that begins with a patient plugging in a private key to unlock their own file within the hospital’s network. I imagine data relationships built upon principles of trust rather than commodity exchange. I imagine open-access libraries of information to make informed analysts of us all.

As I write this, every move made with a phone is tracked and turned into useful information. By accepting this, we may begin to relate to data not as digital waste existing in a digital landfill, but as an integral extension of our networked bodies. Data-bodies form by proxy through a digital _tap tap tap_ consciousness upload, feeding algorithms hosted under heavy guard in server farms to rival industrial agriculture, while the earth fights humanity for its right to life. Bodies are subsumed by numbers and keywords, algorithms guess at how to best make users consume more of the information monoculture powered by fossils and rare earth metals.

Sensing data’s extension of the body requires evolving awareness of how data is harvested. Data-bodies are all trans, as they shift and evolve alongside the corporeal. Through the repetition of specified bodily acts, bodies are reworked. Identity is not an essence but an action. Knowing that cameras can ID passersby and that smartphones record our conversations is a rudimentary starting point. What is bodily sovereignty anymore? Who has absolute autonomy within the territory of their body? We are not merely watched beings.

The steps I take for digital self-defence are a matter of breathing clearly when I log on. Why should my personal research habits create profit for the digital ruling class? Why should my computing be a means of enabling my own exploitation? Why shouldn’t I have control over when and where information about me appears? By the most benign of activities, my own thought tendencies have surely got me on a list somewhere. So what? The more inflated the list of dissidents, the safer each individual. I’ll suspiciously browse Wikipedia all day long so that those conducting direct action online have more traffic to hide within. Online security tools must be taken up by everyone, so that we all become suspect. There is no overwhelming the surveillance algorithms, they are designed to collect everything. If that’s the case, everything ought to be done to make the filters pick up false positives.

Digital self-defence spreads fog over the network. Simple tools are at every user’s disposal. I invite you to click through to some of the links below for an empirical take on much of what has been discussed in this essay as well as tools to make your own browsing more secure, less exploitable.

This blog post does not account for so many realms of experience. Digital self-defence is a meaningless concept to a vast population whose existence, in fact, makes possible my thinking about it. Writing on high-end laptop purchased with a student loan to facilitate my university education in a colony state, the solutions I find for myself are the result of mining and factory work on the other side of the globe, brought here by transoceanic shipping. Data itself is the map which directs resource extraction, controls factory floors, and routes the millions of containers. Digital self-defence is meaningless when there is no network, when payment for a day’s work is a bag of rice, when labour does not mean staring at a screen but breaking down ships on the shores of bangladesh. All these obscene realities make possible my writing, your reading. I don’t know what to do. So I write about the digital intangible on this little metal box.
