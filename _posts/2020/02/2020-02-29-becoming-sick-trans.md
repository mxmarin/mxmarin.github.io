A friend replied to [The Transfusion 07](https://mxmarin.substack.com/p/a-visit-to-the-blood-doctor). They said:

> Picturing you as a protagonist on some wild life ride helps me digest the fact that everything you're experiencing is real and at times scary. I think I would worry far too much otherwise. I hope your newsletter allows you to experience some form of escapism, if only for a few fleeting moments. How could you not, with all that imagery?

As with all replies, I appreciate the time taken to read, consider, and respond to my words. I deeply cherish the exchanges that arise from this space. This edition of the Transfusion is my public response.

Dear Readers, The Transfusion is not for me a form of escapism. Lately, I've been experiencing feelings that I don't yet have the right language to describe. Some of what I feel is vigour, passion, lust, sorrow, loss. My body feels sore but good, which is an unusual combination for me. I feel connected to the world yet distant. Perhaps most importantly, I feel angry that the world is so many of the ways that it is right now. I feel possessed by rage, which I'm beginning to realize is at the root of how I choose to be in the world. I feel as though the quote-unquote "sickness" that has shaped my life and led to this newsletter is little more than a political fiction. I do not mean narrative fiction with political themes. Someone reading a novel or a story can close the book and leave the realm of fiction behind. There is an important difference between political fiction and narrative fiction: inescapability. Political fiction is the realm of lived experience formed by all our received notions of what is and is not possible in reality. Political fiction is the language I learned to use to identify myself with people, groups, categories. Name, sex, gender, political status. It feels as though the words I've used to describe myself over the course of my life are becoming increasingly senseless. "How about we all go around and introduce ourselves? Let's do names, pronouns, and anything else you feel like sharing." Matthieu-Xavier Marin, Human, assigned Male, Immune Thrombocytopenia & Depression, Canadian, White of skin and heritage. All of these words are useful short-hand for use on official documents. For many people whose legal identity markers differ in ways from mine, these words are necessary for survival, for recognition and access to essential community and services. These Words are not identity. I believe there is no essential identity, only a shifting set of relations, many of which determine social-political status. I use these words regularly in order to access medication, credit, lodging; they remain political fictions. The same system which designates me as Male leads to my diagnosis as Chronically ill, [A nice boy.](https://mxmarin.substack.com/p/transfusion-04-i-reviewed-this-nice-boy-whose) Politically, I am my "deficient" immune system as much as I am a male of legal voting age. In actuality, I am not Matthieu-Xavier Marin, though that is the name that appears on my passport and will appear on my baccalaureate. I echo here Paul B. Preciado's words:

> I am not a man and I am not a woman and I am not heterosexual I am not homosexual I am not bisexual. I am a dissident of the sex-gender system. I am the multiplicity of the cosmos trapped in a binary political and epistemological system. ([An Apartment on Uranus](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2020/01/30/an-apartment-on-uranus/))

That is why I sign this newsletter M-X Marin. I do not yet have a new name. I make do with my legal initials, it is a good compromise. For me, being trans _is_ being sick. I do not seek medical/legal transition. My gender (or lack thereof) and my political identity are as real as my illness. My body is already the product of modern medicine, and official Womanhood does not call out to me. My body has been the blood of unknown others worldwide, was the Penicilin I took for over a decade, and is the [anti-haemorrhage pills](https://mxmarin.substack.com/p/a-visit-to-the-blood-doctor) I take every day now. I do not want or need synthetic estrogen to cease being Male, I have long since been in transition. My body has been in revolt against the sex-gender system from the moment my immune system went haywire and began attacking its host: Me. The moment a twist of fate blinded one of my eyes I was no longer the Male fiction which was assigned to me at birth, I was (and am) A Patient. And now, I am learning how to cope with the dis-identification from masculinity, sickness, and health. There is no escaping these fictions which shape my body and yours. Every time I go to a clinic I reaffirm the fiction that is Matthieu-Xavier Marin, the fiction of masculinity, the fiction of Immune Thrombocytopenia, all in order to receive treatment which increases my quality of life. When the power to withhold treatment may be so quickly brandished, I act counter to my beliefs. If medicine could treat bodies without gendering them, if it were possible to be considered a sovereign political subject without necessarily being M or F, millions of people would not share my problem. In the current binary system, it is not possible. Honestly, not undergoing Official Transition is a form of harm reduction, of not making more friction for myself. In naming these political fictions, I do not deny their material reality. But new fictions must be invented in order to account for the multiplicity of experience. So, I'm trans, another convenient word to describe political fiction. In reference to me, the appropriate pronouns to use are (en): they/she (fr): iel/ielle. Example: — did you read M-X's Transfusion 08? — ya they sure said a few things huh The Transfusion is not escape. I write it in order to speak. I am writing to engage in dialogue. I am writing with others to redefine what is possible, in order to bring new versions of myself into existence. This newsletter is an enactment of who I am in the world right now. It is my way of playing with language until I can find out how to describe and share what my reality consists of. The Transfusion speaks my own truth. I am speaking the death of my masculinity, of my sick human body, and of the fictions which have shaped my worlds, in all the complexity that entails. All this, in order to better imagine new possibilities for existing with each other.
