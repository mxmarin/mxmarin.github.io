I live for myself. How could it be any other way? I am selfish. I acknowledge that within my own life, my wellbeing comes first. It is by keeping myself alive that I can best support others. Those I love, who turn to me for support, I want to be there for them. If I do not do what I must in order to feel good and whole within myself, I cannot sustainably support others. Our lives, intertwined, I do not wish them extirpated, no matter what the government regulations stipulate. I want to enmesh us further, to know what comes of closeness. To do this, we must learn when to say 'No. Enough. Not right now.' This is not up to authority to determine, it is individual responsibility. So long as I am able, I will turn this ability into good. I am no better or worse than anyone else. Each of us is here, and learning what that means. How can anyone possibly presume to know what's best for another person? We all have different answers. I tend my own garden and share the harvest. I strive to glean carefully what each world-fragment has to share. To recognize and shed prejudice, gather each thing on its own as a whole part of the larger universe. Daily I take stock of my capacity. Variability and fluctuation unlike ever before. Or perhaps I'm just more perceptive. I've been in a more personally tumultuous state before. Now, the tumult is far more externalized. My inner life is relatively calm. I notice its intricacies in more detail, it is with both apprehension and excitement that I write down my dreams. I aim to Stop expecting a text back. Stop demanding a response. Each of us is overwhelmed by demands on our attention. Forget any notion that you are more important than any one else. I am not any more important than anyone else, don't get back to me if you don't have the energy, and please do not feel guilty. Everyone on earth, without exception, is part of what is underway ever after this state of limbo. Share what matters to you, far and wide, regardless of expectation. Make no demands on the energy of others unbidden, but do not be afraid to share. What is it that is keeping you going right now? No matter how benign, someone else agrees with you. Our ideas must flow with compassion. We feel the way together. How do I feel? I feel my feet cocooned in thin socks, intimately familiar with the old wood floor. I know the floor's dips and inclines, for having stood alone with it. I feel my window facing 120 degrees SE, if my dusty old compass is to be believed. I feel the sun's rays rising through the southeasterly portal. I've cracked the bottom, so I'm stroked by spring breeze and I hear spring sound. I feel excitement and determination, as I focus on my projects. I feel the air I breathe, and I feel the tightness of anxiety in my lungs. I feel both my eyes distinct from one another. I feel the nerves sprouting from the skull's base, connecting me. I see the sun on my skin and sense pleasant warmth. I bear a light ache in my heart as sad thoughts of distant separation come to mind. I pause, and read a paragraph from Phèdre aloud to myself. Unable to digest more than that at once, I lay the book back down on my desk. Plato's Socrates is opposed to allegorical interpretation of the world. Following the Oracle at Delphi's guidance, he chooses to focus on learning himself. And who do I presume to be? One whose voice rings clear within the depths of my own flesh. A body is anything but transparent, we contain far more than the sum of our parts. Each action I take for my own wellbeing drives me forward toward a higher version of myself. Completing even the most benign tasks is part of the puzzle. Self-care is primordial. I love this world. I love existing with/in it. I love its simplicity and complexities, in all its joy and sadness. The wellspring of sensation runs deeper than we can ever know. All my efforts to feel deeply spiral together, sharper and deeper, plunging my body into itself. I leave aside preconceptions about what it is possible for me to feel, and take new/familiar sensations as they come, not disbelieving my own grasp of reality. Why should I ever tell myself a feeling is false? I am blessed with an honest body, one which attempts no trickery. It is with time and patience that I learn the grammar of sensation. There is no formula for love, there is only acknowledgement of its possibility and dedication to its practice. [Love is a choice](https://secretfeministagenda.com/2020/03/20/episode-4-16-choosing-love-with-kai-cheng-thom/) (podcast link). Inner life is inherently true, there is no contradicting solipsistic experience. Inner life risks becoming false when it butts up against the outer world and its many contradictions, yet the truth of inner life does not make it serene. Truth can be chaos, hurt, confusion. It is through acceptance that I begin to make sense of my truth. Facing unpleasant truth is difficult. It's much simpler to focus only on positives, to live as though everything ought to be pleasurable all the time. Even now, there are so many positives. Focusing on pain is a necessary means of better understanding my place in the world, my relationship to my past, my needs in the present, and my desire for a future. Not only those material wants which lend themselves to a certain lifestyle, but also the wants of my soul. So many questions from disparate sources with ongoing answers, uncited:

- What is the capacity for violence? Choosing responsibility. Thinking critically. Claiming one's own. Natural disasters. Shock and accident. Learning to wink.
- What do we harness, to grow in power? Many forms of magic. Pure force of will. Knowledge, power. Words, plants. Learning, always. Choosing trust, presence. En-corps, encore.
- Who are we? Individuals indissociable from the collective. Ongoing apprenticeship ever deepening.
- How can we be meaningfully frightened? The immanence of the political in the prosaic of our lives. Material ecologies of presence. Pain in this sense is more an occasion for art than a cause.
- What happens when the temporarily-able-bodied, the not-ill, begin to roam again? Embodied limbo. Choosing precepts.

What is the value of escape in living with presence? How do we balance Here+Now with Then+There in order to survive pandemic's emotional toll? What is it about stories of unreal proportions that feel so liberating? Storytelling is freedom-making. The reading of stories is a cure for loneliness and it is an amnesiac. Reading is a matter of embodying the reality suggested in the text. There is a great beauty in this temporary commandeering of memory. Give up on courage, and escape. How wonderful, that I might ignore human suffering for a time, and empathize with narrative fiction instead. Draped in political fictions, waking life hurts me to bear. So much is wrong and so much is uncertain. In re-reading a familiar story, I can suspend my knowledge of how much I do not know here and now, to indulge in knowing some future, and strap into the tumult leading up to an ending. For there is an end, even to 3000 page sagas. The printed page is graciously static. It does not risk slipping into new terrifying realms of as-yet-unimagined unknowns. I have picked a narrative I know, I am familiar with the arc upon which I will fly. And there, escaping into other identities, I find comfort.

There is no going back to 'normal.' Normal? As opposed to pathological. Normal as in 'healthy'? There can be no back because what pandemic reveals is the political fiction of health. We have never been healthy. Health is a story woven by institutional power in order to create a reality in which it is possible to negate certain lives on the basis of 'abnormality' or 'pathology.' Pandemic extends the logic of treatment to everyone. Prevention is currently the treatment preached by the government of canada, so that we may slow the spread of COVID-19 and not overwhelm our 'public healthcare' infrastructure. The infrastructure relies on previous expectations of how many might fall ill at a given time, and the built environment reflects that calculus. The status of illness in society is undergoing radical change, as we all now may be sick. What does it mean to be considerate of fellow humans, living in close quarters? It's 5 in the morning, I'm up as usual, and the neighbours below me are singing. I don't think they slept. It seems they waited to hear footsteps before breaking out the guitar. They have belted soft melancholy into the early dawn. I feel the floor rumble beneath my feet. It's early, but then, there is no too early for music. It is a matter of body-clocks, social-clocks, unplugging digital clocks. My neighbours doubtlessly need this music now, though most of us are quiet at this, the last hour before sunrise. I cannot reproach them their joy and their camaraderie as it rubs off on me. Sing another song, boys.
