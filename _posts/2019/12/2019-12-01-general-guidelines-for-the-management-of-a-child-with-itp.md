The above image is a scan of a single page photocopy of an informational handout of unknown origin. In all likelihood, it was among the first documents that Maman received from healthcare professionals after my diagnosis in 2001, and it appears to be directed at schoolteachers. It’s a little bit outdated. Most notably, ITP is now called ‘Immune Thrombocytopenia’ rather than ‘Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura’, and there are more treatment options than two decades ago. I have had ITP for 18 years now. Research from 2018 estimates that immune thrombocytopenia is found in 8.8 out of 100‘000 children. The same research also finds that in 25% of ITP cases, the condition becomes chronic, persistent: it simply does not go away. New diagnosis: Chronic Immune Thrombocytopenia, found in 2.2 out of 100‘000 children. I am one of the few whose ‘benign disease’ turned into the ‘chronic form’; In the first year of treatment I received steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and had my spleen removed. I took penicillin daily for nearly a decade to stave off bacterial infection. Treatment is still only palliative, meaning that my doctors and I manage my symptoms but do not seek a cure. My ITP is always around, and anytime my immune system is activated, it seeks out and destroys my platelets. I’m struck by the particular choice of words: ‘benign disease’. Medical conditions are called benign to suggest they are not dangerous or serious. Benign can also mean kind, or kindly. As if auto-immunity were ever benign. Auto-immunity is endlessly alienating and confusing. As a kid, I understood logically that I ‘was sick’ and might someday ‘get better’, but was wholly unequipped to deal with the emotional and psychological repercussions of living with a body that may or may not be bleeding at all times. Think of it this way: my body is a black box and my veins are Schrödinger’s cat. The handout has a very limited definition of ‘life-style’ but does capture the restrictions imposed by ITP. Immunosuppressed to avoid self-destruction, and no ‘bodily contact sports’ to avoid potential external dangers–I was a very isolated kid, but I don’t mean to sound down about it all. I turned out alright, but yeah, it sucked at the time. This document provided general information and guidelines for managing me, the child with ITP. It was intended for adults to have at least a vague sense of what was Wrong™ with me and adjust their treatment accordingly. As far as I recall, I never got a handout. Or counselling, until I sought it out myself 15 years down the line. It is my intention in this newsletter to vulgarize and translate my experience of illness in such a way to be informative and engaging. I want to share what I’ve been through, what I am still going through, in the hope that my words will resonate with others. I am not a doctor, I am a lifelong patient. In attempting to explain the research I do, I may get things wrong. I ask that you forgive such errors as you notice, and engage in a dialogue with me. Thanks to Maman’s recordkeeping, I have a filing cabinet of my medical transcripts, letters, general information and the like which covers most of my childhood post-diagnosis. The Transfusion, this newsletter, is where I aim to disentangle it. I am setting out on an archaeological dig of the medical knowledge that was produced about me. I am writing The Transfusion because I want to share, that these words may go out to all interested parties. Blood is a tricky object, and I hope we may make sense of it together. It is fundamental to our very lives, but too often ignored. A taboo object, usually only discussed when shed. I will record my thoughts and feelings in an attempt to make sense of it all, and send out a missive every two weeks. I invite you to join me on the journey, a Transfusion every couple of weeks, to keep us going.
