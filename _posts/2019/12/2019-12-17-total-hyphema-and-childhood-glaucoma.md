I am looking at a letter that was faxed from my then-ophthalmologist in Vancouver, BC, to my soon-ophthalmologist in Ottawa, ON. I’ve redacted any personally identifiable information about either of them, for privacy. In this email, I’m adding another moving part to the story, without which an introduction to my medical and personal histories couldn’t be complete. Right before I was diagnosed with [Immune Thrombocytopenia](https://buttondown.email/mxm/archive/f1b6d976-8e9d-47a2-b20d-3d5dcc1ae7d7), I was playing by myself while I waited for maman to finish meeting with my kindergarten teacher. I had just been given back a toy that was confiscated from me by said teacher, and I was very excited to resume playing with it. One of these: [![Joycopter toy](https://buttondown.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/5c95b77a-d123-4c67-9b0b-d786a80b7138.jpg)](https://buttondown.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/5c95b77a-d123-4c67-9b0b-d786a80b7138.jpg) As fate would have it, the spinning toy turned against me and flew at my right eye, causing permanent damage. It was a red day. We weren’t used to those. Red as to stain my vision. Red with weep, sorrow. Red with pain, confusion. Red like the couches and the carpets in the first clinic my mother brought me to, the one that started that started it all. Red that seeped into my right eye after a moment of inattention in the school yard, all thanks to the serrated plastic edge of a joycopter. The clinic we went to referred us to British Columbia Children’s Hospital. It’s unnerving to think that without this injury, I may not have been brought to a clinic or hospital anytime soon, and would have wandered the world of childhood, platelet-less, extremely vulnerable to any physical injury, with no one the wiser and no diagnosis. I’m grateful that my vulnerability made itself known through this eye injury, rather than blunt impact to something more vital. In the subsequent months my eye bled into itself repeatedly, so I eventually lost all ‘useful’ vision. “Total hyphema” refers to complete filling of eye’s anterior (front) chamber with blood: [![Eye graphic](https://buttondown.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/c5104017-5532-4c22-8100-98098c51df19.jpg)](https://buttondown.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/c5104017-5532-4c22-8100-98098c51df19.jpg) In my case, this led to glaucoma and loss of sight. I don’t know when exactly it was that my right eye stopped Seeing. I don’t remember what it’s like to see out of both eyes. I don’t miss it. I may as well have been born like this, were it not for the noted Intraocular Pressure. Intraocular pressure (IOP) is the mesure of pressure that has built up within a given eyeball. Eye pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Normal eye pressure ranges from 12-22 mm Hg, and eye pressure of greater than 22 mm Hg is considered higher than normal. After surgery, my doctor notes, my glaucoma-affected eye was found to be at a satisfactory 22 mm Hg. Excellent, I adore being satisfactory. What the doctor’s don’t mention amongst themselves is the impact of this intraocular pressure on basic quality of life. IOP causes pain, and when my right eye was in pain, the signals interfered with the left, the ‘useful’ eye. I couldn’t focus on anything, concentrate, or, god forbid, hold sustained eye contact. I felt isolated and alone. I’ve mentioned before that ITP meant I was barred from most forms of physical activity as a kid. IOP meant sleepless nights that bled into fuzzy days and years of ocular shut-in. At school, sitting in a corner, book in hand, my glaucoma turned me into a Curiosity for other children. They were usually well-meaning, and sometimes not. My right eye developed a cloudy white-green-blue colour that I have grown to appreciate and love in my adult life. Not so, as a child. From the age of 5, when I ‘lost’ my vision, until the age of 16 or so, when I had my last eye surgery to-date, my unseeing eye would regularly keep me up at night in agony until I passed out from exhaustion. When I was little, maman and I had a routine: First, I would scream or whimper, sometime in the evening, usually around bedtime, when I was already tired and no longer had the capacity to ignore the discomfort. Being tired always makes the eye act up, even to this day. So, I would make known that I was in pain, one way or another, and try to smother it in a pillow or a series of cold-compresses. IOP pain feels like my eye is going to explode. It felt like an ever-inflating ball inside my skull. I couldn’t see out of the offending eye, so where sight used to be there was only invisible pain. I kind of understood what was going on, but that was of little comfort in day-to-day life. Children have no qualms about pointing, staring, asking intrusive questions, venturing patchwork guesses about the nature of someone’s Difference. I heard everything from “your eye grants you oracular powers” (which I like) to “your eye is that way because someone’s cum got stuck in it” (which fueled internalized homophobia that has been a heck of a time to shed). Kids say stupid things, nothing new here. Still, it’s important for me to acknowledge how physical difference, especially aesthetic/visible difference from others, can be deeply alienating as a child. My visual impairment is a minor disability that has not gotten in the way of most things I attempt to do in life. Self-effacing caveat aside, having a single blind eye made me the target or harassment and bullying for years. Sometimes it took the form of a kid hiding around a corner, waiting to jump-scare me on my blind (two-birds-one-stone and all that), and then holding my inability to see over my head at any opportunity. Sometimes there were snide comments. Oftentimes there was no harm meant, but I still felt myself ever more alienated from my peers as a result of Seeing different and looking different. Anyone with eyes is likely to agree: an eye is a very sensitive, delicate ball of goop. Just as much as eyes are the much-vaunted windows to the soul, eyes are a means to an end. In this image-saturated culture, sight is how we apprehend the world around us, it is what we are taught to focus on as the sense of Primary Importance. Seeing is primordial to Normal Existence, and eye-contact is how we first build empathy and human connection. I never regained that much lauded Useful Vision in my right eye. By medical standards, my sight is subpar (_shrug_) and my remaining eye must be protected (I tend to agree with this second point). Instead of Useful Vision my stunted optic nerve, behind its total hyphema and glaucoma, reacts to light and dark, picks up on movement and extends my proprioception–my sense of spatial awareness–in ways that differ from Seeing, and that I have grown to take for granted. My right eye won’t leave my ‘useful’ left vision alone. It gets in the way. In my living memory I have never ‘seen double’, but my optic nerve has always kept providing me with some kind of information. My right eye does not see, but it feels. It feels the wind on a cold winter day. It feels the warmth of direct sunlight like exposed skin. My occluded, not-useful ball of sense receptors has maintained hyper-sensitivity to light. The right eye feeds me never ending waves of colour and light patterns, a visual world of my own whenever I focus on it.
