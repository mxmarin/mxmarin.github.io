Biking west along side roads, I whiffed the hospital complex  two blocks away. Industrial cleanser reaches my nose through the black cotton mask. Lock up, walk the final 50 feet to the CHUM. People cluster as we attempt to form a line and follow the signposted instructions. Disinfect hands. Everyone's masked. Security guards mill about, and a nondescript hospital employee guides people where they need to go.

_Do you have an appointment? Where are you headed?_

Centre Intégré de Cancérologie, 14th floor, I've got a blood test to do today.

_Oh, you know you have a separate entrance and elevators right? Here, come with me. By coming in that way, you won't have to pass through the entire hospital and touch stuff that's supposedly disinfected even though no one really cleans it._

Thank you, I say and ponder the horror of that last statement as I make my way through to the Oncology-Elevators, disinfecting hands again though I haven't touched anything. Two of us are whisked up in a socially-distanced elevator ride. Maximum occupancy of 4, one person in each corner, guarding a floor-sticker. Upstairs I am greeted by a nurse who asks the usual symptom-probes. The nurse's hands brush up against mine as she leans in to spray sanitizer and disinfect me once more. I didn't even press the elevator buttons. A volunteer in a bow-tie walks me down the long waiting room to point out the blood-work reception desk, which has not moved in the 6 months since I was last here. I was supposed to return sooner, but there's a pandemic going on as I write this.

The _centre de prélèvements_ is a resolutely functional and hygienic place. Blood draws occur 7am-3pm M-F. Wait times are short for patients who get blood taken here up high. I ask a nurse how many blood tests a day they're doing lately. "It depends, but a little over 100." Out the window I see the sky, the city, beyond. Nearby another patient sits down and opens a book: The Most Beautiful Quebecois Poems. I glance back out and a small brown-speckled spider weaves its web across the glass. From where I'm standing it's bigger than the construction workers, bigger than the pedestrians, almost the size of the police cruiser two intersections away. Standing there, refusing to sit in a waiting-room chair, I wonder what all the poetry in the world is worth when compared to this single arachnid.

They've been working on adding a third even taller wing to the CHUM first completed in 2017. Before then, I got my blood tests at _l'hôpital notre-dame_, which opened in 1880. The CHUM built now has another high capacity blood-draw clinic on the main floor of D-wing but I've never sat there in that glass box within the heart of the skyscraper complex with no view outside for patients. No, for some reason I take the elevator. Once though I stayed overnight at the Nouveau-CHUM in an ER hallway on a cot under fluorescents. It was mid-march of 2019. In the morning my managing haematologist is on duty and comes to see me at bedside. I say I'm fine. He says _You're not fine listen to these numbers we'll up your dose of Revolade and deliver intravenous iron also request an appointment with the gastroenterologist because surely if you're this anaemic your stomach must be bleeding._ Alright then. As he discharges me, the doctor jokes about how nice the rooms are up on the 15th floor, as if hospitalization is the right thing to chuckle warmly about. I think he's well-intentioned and has a good grasp of haematological medicine, but I was glad to leave, go home, and spend a month in bed resting as the weather turned warm outside.

Sharp insertion somewhere along the arm. Middling. My auto-immune system has been known to eat away at platelets and bleed under its skin. When platelets are particularly low, I get acutely aware of my skin's surfaces and folds, distracted by specks of the outer world that brush up against it. Skin feels egg-albumin thin. The lightest pressure might bruise and the lightest scrape might tear. The circulatory system is a series of veinous corridors, highways, canals, transit arteries carrying blood along. Internal bleeding's a slow dissolving of venous layers melding into a contiguous ocean of blood. Carefully mapped out roads falling into disarray as in-betweens flood. Microscopic terror as a shortage of platelets leads to tidal waves overcoming the sea walls under maintained, decimated by an overzealous team of white blood cells. If this shows up to the naked eye at all, it's usually as 'petechiae'; tiny red pinpoints in the skin, little red-blue dots along the arms, the legs, around the groin. Mini-bruises. Even invisible illness is subject to sight. ITP's primary symptoms are: excessive bruising, bruising in excess of what one would’ve expected for the amount of trauma, or bruises that are totally unexplained. When my daily life is clinically asymptomatic, the blood work makes sure to rectify the notion that everything is normal. Platelet counts under the norm are my everyday and have been for 19 years. A normal amount of blood platelets is 150'000-300'000 per microliter of blood, and my counts in 2019 alone were between 9000 and 427'000.

Can we stop counting anytime soon? Medicine is obsessed with blood. Put it under an electron microscope and find out just how its balance turns out. Break it down into categories for testing, count out with frightening exactitude just how much of this that and whatever else my body happened to contain at XX:YY on XYZ day. My haematologist's job is precisely to make sense of the minutiae contained within blood. Logic takes a crack at making sense of our lifeblood, and I can't help but laugh.
