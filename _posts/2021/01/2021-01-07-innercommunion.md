title: Inner Communion
---
How do I communicate with the invisible aspects of my body, with that which is occulted? Sensing blood and tissue and bone, the watery and the earthen self. There's no quantitative analysis available for making rational sense of this relationship, there is only a quality of divine apprehension that may be glimpsed when I am allowed to return to the source. Void of preconceived notions limiting what may be possible, I encounter a depth charge that shatters expectations. Taking the heart for a drum beat, beat, ever onward inward seeking not after answers but for ever more precise questions. For it is in the asking that insight is revealed. 

I pause, and wonder whether this journey is plausible. Balk at myself momentarily: "Ha! You're in no position to understand." Yet shed these doubts, for if not I then whom? Surely no external measure no number holds the key to my flesh. It is not written in law that I may not know myself. Any such contract is none that I have agreed to, and as such is one I reject. No intermediary may intervene on my behalf, no priest/ess teach me what is true. 

The needle interjects: "I shall enumerate the reality of your blood." Only if I should let it, shall it dictate to me the truth of this body. Again today I sat in a blue chair to bleed red feed the sterile machinery. To what end? Months without counting have left me alive, awake to internal alchemy. Last november I stopped taking the pharmaceuticals I'd been prescribed. A nurse asks: "Who told you to do that?" No one, it was an autonomous decision. We'll see what the doctor has to say about the numbers abstracting my lifeblood, when we next speak on the phone.

I know myself by practicing, by attempting, by sharing, by delving, by attending, by devotion. I seek the questions to illumine the body's iterative becoming, it's multiplicity of discontinuities. Never shall I presume to have reached a conclusion. Never shall the flesh have revealed itself fully. To make such presumptions is folly--from there the inevitable decline. So long as I maintain my ignorance, I have so much to learn, so much to learn.
