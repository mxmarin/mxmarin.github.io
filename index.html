    		<h3>Hi there, I'm M-X Marin!</h3>
				<p>I'm a chronically ill writer who's into de-urbanizing. I grew up in cities across so-called Canada, and am now out to find other ways of living on this continent.

				<p>I've got a degree in in Communication Studies from Concordia University in Tio'Tia:Ke (Montréal). I'm interested in permaculture, cultural theory, illness, SF literature, forestry, and decentralized forms of resistance.</p>

				<p>My work has appeared The Scattered Pelican, Insight Journal, and this blog. I previously maintained a bi-weekly newsletter about my experiences with chronic illness entitled The Transfusion. I make electroacoustic music, under the name <a href="https://thrombocyte.bandcamp.com"> Thrombocyte </a>, and digital visual art, having exhibited at Rose Festival and the VAV Gallery in Montréal, with publications in Darkslide.</p>
