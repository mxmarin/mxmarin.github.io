<h3>Hi, salut, M-X here!</h3>

<p> Here you can read my essay: <a href="/2020/08/25/oncology-in-the-sky">The Oncology Ward In The Sky.</a></p> 
				
<p> Or, if you'd like, you're welcome to <a href="/blog">scroll</a> along my blog.</p>

<p>My current writing project is wandering the woods to ponder the meaning of patience. I grew up in cities across so-called Canada, and am now out to find other ways of living on this continent. I've got a degree in Communication Studies from Concordia University in Tio'Tia:Ke. I'm interested in permaculture, illness, sf, forestry, and decentralized forms of resistance.</p>

<p>My work has appeared in  <i>The Scattered Pelican</i>, <i>Insight</i>, and <i>Darkslide</i>. I previously maintained a bi-weekly newsletter about my experiences with chronic illness titled <i>The Transfusion</i>, which populates the early posts on my blog.
