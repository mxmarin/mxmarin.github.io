    		<h3>Hi, salut, M-X here!</h3>

				<p> On this site, you can read my essay: <a href="/2020/05/05/oncology-in-the-sky">The Oncology Ward In The Sky</a></p>

<div class="blurb">
				<p>I'm a chronically ill writer who's into de-urbanizing. My current writing project is wandering the woods to ponder the meaning of patience. I grew up in cities across so-called Canada, and am now out to find other ways of living on this continent. I've got a degree in in Communication Studies from Concordia University in Tio'Tia:Ke (Montr√©al). I'm interested in permaculture, cultural theory, illness, SF literature, forestry, and decentralized forms of resistance.</p>

				<p>My work has appeared in<i>The Scattered Pelican</i>, <i>Insight</i>, and <i>Darkslide</i>. I previously maintained a bi-weekly newsletter about my experiences with chronic illness titled <i>The Transfusion</i>, which populates the early posts on my blog. I also sometimes make electroacoustic music as <a href="https://thrombocyte.bandcamp.com">Thrombocyte</a>.
