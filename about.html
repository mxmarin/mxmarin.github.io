I am a is a sick, blind, trans person with a degree in in Communication Studies from Concordia University. I'm interested in permaculture, cultural theory, illness, SF literature, forestry, and decentralized forms of resistance. My work has appeared The Scattered Pelican, Insight Journal, and this blog. I previously maintained a bi-weekly newsletter about my experiences with chronic illness entitled The Transfusion. I make electroacoustic music, under the name [Thrombocyte](https://thrombocyte.bandcamp.com), and digital visual art, having exhibited at Rose Festival and the VAV Gallery in Montr√©al, with publications in Darkslide.
